Description: The "Duplicate Hider" Playnite extension hides duplicate copies of the same game based on customizable priorities. By default games with the same name are treated as duplicates. Creating custom groups or advanced features like regular expressions allow to keep different names while treating them as duplicates. Select game details can be copied to duplicates. Various fields being part of game details like source, library, installation status, platform and many more can be used for the prioritization. Higher priorities are checked first and lower priorities are only used if there's still no distinct order. Both manual and automatic hiding of duplicates is possible. The extension offers custom user interface elements for usage in themes that allow easy access to duplicates.
